**Iris Neural Network**

This project builds a neural network with n hidden layers to predict class labels for the Iris plant dataset.

The data is split into a training and testing set. I choose to use the sigmoid activation function.

Forward and Backwards propogation is implemented from scratch and the accuracies on the training/test data sets are reported.
